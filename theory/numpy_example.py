NumPy is a Python extension module. It provides fast and efficient operations on 
arrays of homogeneous data. 
NumPy extends python into a high-level language for manipulating numerical data
It is the core library for scientific developent in Python.

Numpy Arrays:
A numpy array is a grid of values, all of the same type and is indexed by a tuple of 
non negative integers.
The number of dimensions is the rank of the array; the shape of the array is a tuple
of integers giving the size of the array along with each dimension

import numpy as np
a = np.array([1,2,3])
